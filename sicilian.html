    <h1 style="color: white;font-size:30px;">Description</h1><br>
    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5) is one of the most aggressive and complex responses to <br>
        1.e4. It creates an asymmetrical position that offers Black dynamic counterplay, particularly on the queenside, while White usually attacks on the kingside.<br>
         There are many sub-variations like the Najdorf, Dragon, and Sveshnikov, each with its own sharp and theoretical character.<br>
         It is a favorite at all levels due to its winning chances and fighting nature.

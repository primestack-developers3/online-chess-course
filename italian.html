    <p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The Italian Game is a classic chess opening that begins with the moves:<br>
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4<br>

It focuses on quick development, center control, and early pressure on Black's weak f7 square.<br> White’s bishop on c4 targets f7, while the knight on f3 supports the center and eyes g5 for tactical threats.<br>

One of the main responses by Black is 3...Bc5, leading to the Giuoco Piano (“quiet game”), a slower, positional battle.<br> If Black plays 3...Nf6, it leads to the sharper Two Knights Defense, where tactical skirmishes are common.<br>

White often follows up with c3 and d4, aiming to take over the center.<br> The game usually continues with both sides castling kingside, leading to rich middle-game play.<br>

The Italian Game is popular with beginners and masters alike because it teaches solid opening principles—control the center, develop pieces, and ensure king safety.<br> It can lead to both quiet positional games or aggressive attacks, depending on the variation chosen.<br>

Overall, it’s a versatile and instructive opening that forms a strong foundation for anyone learning or improving at chess.</p><br>
